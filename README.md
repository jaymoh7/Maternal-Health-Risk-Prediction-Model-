# 🧠 Maternal Health Risk Prediction
### SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being — AI for Good Assignment

This AI-driven system predicts maternal health risks using machine learning. It aims to support SDG 3 by enabling early intervention, reducing mortality, and guiding healthcare decisions, especially in under-resourced regions.

## 📌 Project Features

- Synthetic data generation based on real-world maternal health risk factors
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning model training and evaluation
- Feature importance analysis
- Single-patient risk prediction
- Ethical consideration analysis (fairness, privacy, sustainability)
